# Food Ordering Application

## Overview

This is a food ordering application built with **React.js**, allowing users to browse, select, and order food online. The app provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface, simulating a food ordering process that can be easily extended for production use.

## Features

- **Browse Menu**: View a variety of food items, complete with images, descriptions, and prices.
- **Add to Cart**: Users can add items to their cart and view the cart summary at any time.
- **Manage Cart**: Modify the cart by adding or removing items before finalizing the order.
- **Checkout Process**: Simulate an order review and provide an option to proceed to checkout.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: JavaScript library used for building the user interface.
- **React Router**: Used for handling navigation between different views, such as the menu and the cart.
- **State Management**: React's built-in `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for managing application state.
- **CSS**: For styling the application and creating a clean, modern UI.
- **Axios** *(Optional)*: For making API calls to fetch data or handle order processing.
